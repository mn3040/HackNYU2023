# PetPal

Happy pet, happy life - Keep your pal thriving with our app!

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind PetPal was to help future pet owners better understand the maintenance required to keep a pet happy. We realize how difficult and stressful it can be for pet owners to get new pets and not know their signs and behavior. Therefore, our goal is to address this issue.

## What It Does
The app streamlines information that the user would otherwise have to search the internet for painstakingly. The user can select an animal they wish to have as a pet, which will take them to different tabs concerning the pet's basic information, diet, habitat needed for the animal to survive, as well as health concerns to take note of when taking care of the pet.

## How We Built It
We built PetPal using Swift and designed the user interface with Xcode's Interface Builder, utilizing Storyboard files for layout.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Swift was not a language we were used to, so it was a lot of trial and error when creating PetPal. Therefore, we were also limited in the capabilities we could implement in Swift.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We believe that our design is effective in creating a warm and inviting feeling for the user. The design was done to be simple yet clean. We also believe that our idea is important for not only future pet owners but to prevent future animal mistreatment due to misinformation.

## What We Learned
Our app is simple yet powerful in its ability to streamline a process for the user. We realized that when building apps it is important to consider how it might make the user's life just a little bit more comforting and convenient.

## What's Next for PetPal
For the next steps, we wish to add further functionality involving setting appointments with local veterinarians, finding where to adopt/buy these animals, and overall better improving our information so that we may give the user the best guide when it comes to pet handling.
